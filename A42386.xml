            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

True, he ſaith ſo, but he explains his meaning in the ſame place; for he acknowledgeth the Churches of <hi>Greece, Aethiopia, Armenia,</hi> to have been and ſtill to be true viſible Chriſtian Churches; yea, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a part of the Viſible Church of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Anceſtors poſſeſſed the true Faith, as to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles neceſſary to Salvation, and were ſome of them ſaved: So that he acknowledgeth in ſome ſenſe, the Viſibility of the Church,

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any contradiction in this, for a Leper is a true Man, and as truly Viſible as one that is clean. Leproſie is not a diſtinct Body, but a Diſeaſe cleaving to it. In like manner, Popery is not of it ſelf a diſtinct Church, but a corrupt humour in latter Ages predominant in the true Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of God.

Secondly, he denyeth that there is alwaies and at all times in this true Viſible Church a viſible Company or State of People actually and perſonally divided from the reſt that profeſs the True Faith, perform Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip, and exerciſe Church-Diſcipline in open and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous manner, wholly free from the Corruptions and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes of ſuch as have defiled the Church.

The Church of the Jews was the true, yea, the only true Church of God; yet in the time of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and after in our Saviour's days, they were generally ten Tribes of twelve over-run with Idolatry and Superſtition.

               <hi>I know well enough that the Church hath not alwaies, eſpecially in time of Perſecution, ſuch an outward worldly and proſperous eſtate. I grant alſo,</hi> adds he, <hi>that ſometimes the Church is obſcured, as S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>ſaith, with multitude of Scandals, and therefore it is not alwaies alike famous and illuſtrious, eſpecially ſo as to ſhine actually through the whole World.</hi> I will add the Words of another learned Jeſuite, <hi>Greg. de Valentiâ. When we ſay the Church is alway conſpicuous, this muſt not be taken as if we thought it might at all times be diſcerned alike eaſily. For we know, that ſometimes it (i.e.</hi> the Church, the Mountain, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>is ſo toſſed with the waves of Errors, Schiſms, and Perſecutions, that to ſuch as are unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> (as the far greater part of Chriſtians ever are) <hi>and do not diſcreetly enough weigh circumſtances of times and things, it ſhall be very hard to be known; which then eſpecially fell out, when the falſhood of</hi> Arrians <hi>bare rule almoſt over all the World. Therefore we deny not, but that it will be harder to diſcern the Church at ſome time than at other ſome; yet this we avouch, that it alway might be diſcerned by ſuch as could wiſely eſteem things:</hi> So he.</p>
            <p>And is this all they would infer from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>Ye are the light of the world. A City that is ſet on an hill cannot be hid,</hi> &amp;c. Is a Light or City on a hill only diſcernable by a few diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet quick-ſighted perſons? Is this the Viſibility they ſo much contend for? Well, it's here granted us, that the Church is not alway eaſily viſible or diſcernable to all, but only to a few diſcreet Perſons. If this will ſatisfie them, we ſhall readily grant, that the Proteſtant Church under the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and Errors of the Papacy was not eaſily diſcernable, yea was or is hardly viſible to ſuch as are unskilful, and do not wiſely enough weigh circumſtances of times, <hi>viz.</hi> of Oppreſſion and Perſecution: Yet this we ſay, that it might have been diſcern'd even in the next Ages before <hi>Luther,</hi> not only in the <hi>Waldenſes, Wickleviſts, Albigenſes,</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> (how odious and contemptible ſoever they are render'd to

            <p>What great matter then can theſe men make of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Church they ſo much boaſt of?

            <p>I will only add <hi>Coſterus</hi> a noted Writer amongſt them: <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>would have his Church not only</hi> Viſible <hi>but</hi> very conſpicuous, <hi>that the grace of God, which in this Congregation, and not elſewhere, is preſerved and conferred, may be known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men; whence he hath made her like to a City placed on a hill, and to a Candle ſet on a Candleſtick.</hi> Here we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive that a <hi>mere Viſibility</hi> of the Church will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our Adverſaries unleſs it be <hi>very conſpicuous,</hi> ſo as that all Perſons may know it.

            <p>For firſt they ſay, that God would have all men to be ſav'd and come to the knowledge of the truth, and that therefore he affordeth all men ſufficient means to come to the truth. Secondly, They deny that the Scripture, in regard of its imperfection and obſcurity, is ſufficient to this end, but that the teaching of the viſible Church is the Rule of Faith, which all perſons, eſpecially thoſe that are ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn'd, muſt by an implicite faith in all things adhere to. Whence thirdly, it unavoidably follows, that if God afford all men ſufficient means to come to the knowledge of the truth in order to ſalvation, and the teaching of the true Church be the ordinary means appointed thereunto, then the Church muſt be in all ages and places, not only viſible to ſome few diſcreet wiſe perſons, as <hi>Valentia</hi> ſaith, but very conſpicuous and clearly diſcernable to all, even the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and weak-ſighted, like a City ſet on an Hill, &amp;c.

               <note place="margin">Texts alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (as meant by the Papiſts) anſwered.</note>I now come to examine the places of Scripture mention'd in your Letter to evince the contrary.</p>
            <p>The firſt and principal urg'd by <hi>Valentia</hi> and many other is, <hi>Matth,</hi> 15.14, 15. <hi>Ye are the light of the World. A City that is ſet on an Hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46440:9"/>Candle to put it under a Buſhel,</hi> &amp;c. To which may be added, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2.60.20.61.9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14. quoted in your Paper. To all which the ſame Anſwer may be applied.</p>
            <p>My reply is, that thoſe words do not prove a perpetual, conſpicuous and illuſtrious viſibility of the Church in all Ages to all perſons, which our Adverſaries contend for. Firſt, Becauſe the words are not ſpoken, at leaſt directly, of the Church general or ſucceſſive in all Ages, but of and to the Apoſtles perſonally, <hi>Ye are the light of the World.</hi> And ſeeing they were commanded by our Saviour to teach all Nations, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that they were under a ſpecial protection of divine Providence until they had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd the work committed unto them. But the caſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſtors and Teachers of the Church is not the ſame with that of Apoſtles. Secondly, Suppoſe we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words of the Church general or ſucceſſive, which we grant to be a light to the ignorant World and like a City ſet on a Hill; yet it cannot be deny'd, yea our Adverſaries grant it, that this light of Apoſtolick doctrine in the Church may be obſcur'd or eclipſed by error,
<note place="margin">Aug. Epiſt: ad Vincenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſupra.</note> ſcandal and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may be obſcur'd or eclipſed by error, ſcandal and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Sun and Moon ſometimes are, tho they be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and moſt viſible lights.</p>
            <p>In like manner a City ſet on an Hill may be ſo clouded by foggy miſts and vapors that it may become for ſome time inviſible, at leaſt not ſo viſible or conſpicuous as that any man may point at it with his finger.</p>
            <p>The other Similitude of Mens lighting a Candle and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it on a Candleſtick that ſo it may give light to all in the Houſe, ſignifies the clearneſs, univerſality and diffuſiveneſs of the doctrine taught by the Apoſtles. But that any one particular Church, <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman,</hi> ſhould be ſuch a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick as can never fail or be remov'd as well as that of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> and many other Apoſtolical Churches wholly rooted out by <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 2.</note> or which ſhould be, as our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries too groſly affirm, <hi>more viſible</hi> and diſcernable to all men than the light it ſelf (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Goſpel contain'd in the Scripture) plac'd in the Candleſtick, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church; this I ſuppoſe no prudent man will take to be our Saviour's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe words.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:46440:9"/>
            <p>That they make their Church (the Candleſtick) and its Authority more viſible to us than the truth or light of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, is ſo notorious I will not ſtand to prove it.

            <p>The ſecond place is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. Tell the Church; if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen or Publican. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith the Letter, <hi>It were very hard to be condemn'd for a Heathen or a Publican for not hearing a Church that hath ſo cloſely lain hid that none could hear, ſee, feel or underſtand it for</hi> 900. <hi>years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I anſwer, That theſe words prove not the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible or palpable to all men Heathens and Infidels enquiring after the true Church, but at moſt to Chriſtians only who live under the Church's government and ſubmit to her Cenſures. Secondly, The words relate to a particular Chriſtian Church of which a perſon is a member; for it were abſurd to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine our Saviour ſhould oblige any Chriſtian if his Brother ſhould offend him, to tell the whole Catholick Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World his offence <hi>per literas Encyclicas.</hi> Yea, it's plain and undeniable, the place reſpects not the whole diffuſed number of Chriſtians, no not in any particular Church, but the Governours only. Now our Adverſaries will not I hope, ſay that any particular Church, except their own, much leſs its Rulers or Repreſentatives, ſhall be eminently viſible and conſpicuous to all Chriſtians at all times. Certainly our Saviour in this place does not promiſe any ſpecial privilege to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> more than <hi>Antioch, Epheſus</hi> or any other Apoſtolical Church, to whom that Precept of telling the Church doth equally belong; ſome of whom are long ſince utterly extinguiſhed by the overflowing of <hi>Mahometa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi> How can they then from this place infer that any particular Church ſhall be perpetually viſible and conſpicuous to the World exerciſing Church-Government over its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? Nay farther, How could the Chriſtians belonging to their <hi>Roman</hi> Church when under the perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> or <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> (at which time the Shepherds being ſmitten the ſheep were all ſcatter'd, the Church diſſipated and all Church-diſcipline interrupted) tell the Church, or make
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46440:10"/>complaint to the Governours of it, when they ſcarcely knew where they were, to whom in caſe of offence and ſcandal to make complaint. Our Saviour's Precept then ſuppoſes the free exerciſe of Church-government, which in times of violent perſecution cannot be exercis'd or ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>I might add,

            <p>Laſtly, Whereas 'tis objected, that the Proteſtant Church hath ſo cloſely lain hid for 900. years that no man could ſee or underſtand it; this is very falſly affirm'd as I ſhall ſhew afterward, unleſs ſuch as profeſs'd the Religion of the Scriptures, Ancient Fathers and Councils, proteſting againſt ſome new <hi>Roman</hi> additional Articles, impos'd of late by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> and the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Council, were no true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of God.</p>

To this I reply firſt, That altho the Apoſtles were not call'd by the name of Proteſtants, as neither were they by the name of Catholicks or Papiſts, yet they were really of that Religion Proteſtants do profeſs; for from the Apoſtles and their Writings have we learn'd the Religion we maintain againſt additional Popiſh Errors, and traditional or unwritten points of Faith.

            <p>I might add ſeveral other Doctrines and Practices as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture (if I underſtand any thing in it) as Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to Light; particularly,
<note place="margin">Concerning ſome pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which are againſt Scripture. As 1. Service in an unknown Tongue.</note> that unreaſonable ſervice of God in a Tongue the people do not-underſtand. Can any thing be more plainly contradictory to the whole fourteenth Chapter of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there condemn all Speaking, whether in Sermons, Prayers or Thankſgivings, in the Church in an unknown Tongue? <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Unknown, not to God; who knows all things, even Sermons in <hi>Latin, Greek</hi> or any Tongue elſe, but to Men. He prefers Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, <hi>i.e.</hi> Preaching or expounding the Scripture, before Tongues, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſtrange and not underſtood by the Hearers, for this very reaſon; becauſe he that ſpeaketh in an unknown Tongue ſpeaketh to God, not unto men, for no <hi>man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth him, howbeit in the Spirit,</hi> i.e. by a miraculous gift of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46440:19"/>Spirit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 3.</note> as the gift of Tongues was, <hi>he ſpeaketh myſteries,</hi> i. e. profound and admirable Truths. But he that propheſieth or preacheth in a known Tongue ſpeaketh unto men, to Edification, Exhortation and Comfort. He that ſpeaketh in an unknown Tongue edifieth himſelf,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 4.</note> not the Church. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have the whole Church edifi'd or profited by whatever is ſpoken. Hence he commands <hi>ver.</hi> 26. all things to be done to edification, and forbids any one to uſe his miraculous gift of Tongues in the Church unleſs he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret what he ſaith, or another for him, that ſo the Church may receive <hi>Edifying,</hi> i.e. ſpiritual profit, being built up in their moſt holy Faith. Is it not as clear as the day at Noon, that according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s doctrine there is no profit or edification redounding to the People by whatſoever is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Church in an unknown Tongue? Neither doth he in that Chapter ſpeak only of Sermons (Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not ſo abſurd as to preach in <hi>Latin</hi> to their people) or private Conferences, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would evade, he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth generally of whatever is ſpoken in the Church, it muſt be in a Tongue known to the people, that ſo the people may be profited by it, in regard elſe they are not edify'd or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited at all. Neither doth he ſpeak of Sermons only, but Prayers and Thankſgivings: hence <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>I will pray with the ſpirit, and I will pray with the underſtanding alſo, I will ſing with the ſpirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo.</hi> So that in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s judgment it's neceſſary to pray and ſing Praiſes,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 47.7.</note> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, with underſtanding. Then he adds, Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſs (God) with the Spirit, <hi>i.e.</hi> by an extraordinary gift of ſtrange Tongues beſtow'd by the Spirit on many in thoſe days, how ſhall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned ſay Amen <hi>to thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt?</hi> Where two things are as plain as if they had been written with a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam.

<note place="margin">Juſtin. Martyr, Apol. 2.

We uſe, as the ancient Church did, to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to Prayers, not to Sermons or Conferences. So that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly condemns Prayers in an unknown Tongue
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46440:19"/>uſed at this day by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in her <hi>Latin</hi> Service. And there is ground to think this is one reaſon why they ſuffer not the Laity to read the Scriptures, leſt they ſhould by them diſcern this amongſt other of their palpable, erroneous and corrupt practices. This may be a ſecond inſtance that the Romiſh Religion is not Apoſtolical.</p>

Laſtly, I anſwer, The Church of God is not to be govern'd by the late Policies of men, but by the Laws of Chriſt and the example of the Primitive Church; who altho many dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſies aroſe in thoſe Ages,

                     <hi>Ex hac ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudine plerumque etiam ipſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rerum nomina acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Quaeſt. in Levit. lib. 3. cap. 57. <hi>Sicut ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt, ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſpicae ſeptem anni ſunt.

                  </note> they would be no Sacraments. From this ſimilitude for the most part they receive the names of the things themſelves they repreſent.</hi> As then, <hi>ſecundùm quendam modum, after ſome manner, the Sacrament of Chriſt's body is his body, ſo the Sacrament of Faith is Faith.</hi> Thus I hope I have made it evident, that the preſent Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation is no part of the Primitive and Catholick Faith; which the Fathers in the five firſt Centuries after Chriſt owned not, but refuted and condemn'd it.</p>
            <p>I know very well that many things are objected againſt us out of the Fathers, that <hi>Ignatius, Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirm, that the Bread and Wine in the holy Euchariſt is the Body, fleſh and bloud of Chriſt; yea, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> and Saint
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46440:24"/>
               <hi>Ambroſe</hi> declare, That they <hi>are changed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De coena Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.

To all which in brief I anſwer, That we queſtion not the truth of him that ſaid, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> We unfeignedly grant it is ſo, <hi>ſecundum quendam modum,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> above,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. 23.</note> in a true and ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, tho not literal and proper ſenſe. We undoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s infallible Authority, that the Rock in the Wilderneſs of which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> drank was Chriſt; he ſaith not, as Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſomewhere obſerves, it ſignify'd Chriſt, but it was Chriſt; yet no man is ſo ſimple as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe words not in a figurative and improper but a proper and literal ſenſe. Furthermore,

In regard of common bread and wine they are chang'd and converted into an holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, wherein we have Communion with, or real, tho ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, communication of the body and bloud of Chriſt. In like manner, we ſubſcribe to that of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> That they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main what they are, <hi>i.e.</hi> as to ſubſtance, (which directly overthrows Tranſubſtantiation) and yet are changed into other things as to uſe and quality. When in and by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection a natural, mortal and corruptible body is turned into a ſpiritual and immortal one, we all grant the nature of it is changed; yet no good Chriſtian will deny but that it remains for ſubſtance the very ſame body.</p>

                  </note> That by vertue of the Euchariſt Chriſt's body and blood is corporally and naturally united to us.</hi> But this is impertinently alledg'd; for they ſpeak not of the Union of Chriſt's Body and Bloud to the outward Elements of Bread and Wine, but to the ſouls and bodies of all faithful Communicants, and to them onely, who thereby become bone of his bone and fleſh of his fleſh. In a word. As the Fathers ſay, Chriſt's Body is in us,

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46440:25"/>if it be ſo, that our ſubſtance is not turn'd into Chriſt's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, why ſhould we think that the ſubſtance of the bread muſt be changed into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's body?

            <p>Laſtly, They vehemently preſs the ſayings of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and other of the Fathers in their popular Homilies who ſay,

Doſt thou ſee Bread and Wine in the Sacrament? Think it not.</hi> In like manner <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſ. Myſtag.</hi> But ſuch Hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal expreſſions uſed by the Fathers to ſtir up devotion and preſerve an high reverence of the Sacrament in the minds of their Hearers are not to be taken, as our Adverſaries well know, in a ſtrict, literal and dogmatical ſenſe. No Papiſt according to his own principles can rationally hold, that Chriſt's body is corporally preſſed, pierc'd or touch'd by mens teeth, or that their tongues are dyed red with his bloud, ſeeing they affirm that Chriſt's Body is there, <hi>incruentè,</hi> in an unbloudy manner; inſomuch that they acknowledge thoſe words in <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Recantation, tho drawn up by the Pope, <hi>viz.

            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That the Fathers uſe the like Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Hyperbolical expreſſions in their popular Diſcourſes concerning Baptiſm;
<note place="margin">Cap 19. <hi>Paſſio Domini in qua tingimur.</hi> Myſtag. 4. <hi>In Sacramentis, non quid ſint, ſed quid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendant, attenditur; quoniam ſigna ſunt rerum aliud exiſtentia &amp; aliud ſignificantia.</hi> Aug. cont.

Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book of Baptiſm ſaith, that thereby we are <hi>dyed in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or bloud of our Lord.</hi> In like manner <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> after he had inſtructed Chriſtians not to look upon the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament as mere Bread and Wine, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46440:25"/>ſenſe ſuggeſteth, but as the body and bloud of Chriſt, affirmeth the ſame of the Water in Baptiſm, that it is not <gap reason="foreign">

Many more inſtances might be added, but theſe may ſuffice. I will onely take notice of a Similitude uſed by St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> in which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> triumphs. 'Tis this: <hi>As,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Wax ſet on fire loſeth its ſubſtance being turn'd into fire, ſo by conſecration the ſubſtance of the</hi> bread <hi>is chang'd into the fleſh of Chriſt.</hi> To which, and the like expreſſions quoted out of the Fathers,

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notat. 152.</note> Another of their own Church ingenuouſly aknowledgeth that Preachers, ſuch as the Fathers were in their Homilies and popular Diſcourſes, often ſpeak things by an Hyperbole, being carried away, <hi>affectuum impetu &amp; ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis curſu,</hi> with the heat of their affections; <hi>which often,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>befell Chryſoſtom.</hi> Yea,

If ſo; they muſt neceſſarily grant, that not onely the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament ceaſeth to be, but the very outward accidents alſo. For when Wax is fired, not onely the ſubſtance but the very accidents are diſſerent from what they were before. And ſo much at preſent for Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</p>

            <p>But it's objected, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> undoubtedly held Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory as a point of Faith, in regard he alloweth Prayers for the dead, and condemns <hi>Aërius</hi> as an Heretick for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Prayer for the dead doth no way prove the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Purgatory. Or that they for whom the Church an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prayed were in pain or torment; neither doth <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> intimate any ſuch thing, yea he contradicts it in part at leaſt, when he ſaith, <hi>We pray for the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs;</hi> who, as our Adverſaries confeſs, were never in Purgatory, but happy in the Lord. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> pray'd for the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> when deceaſed,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Obitu Valentin. Confeſſ.</hi> lib. 9. cap. ult.</note> yet in the very ſame place he declares that he believ'd he was in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory: Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> alſo pray'd for his Mother <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> when departed; yet immediately adds, that he believ'd God had granted what he begg'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> remiſſion of her ſins and everlaſting life. Prayer then for the dead does not infer Purgatory. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>Let us now hear what Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith in his third Sermon upon the <hi>Philippians,</hi> he makes not three, but onely two ſorts of Chriſtians; Such as die in the true Faith, and ſuch as die in Infidelity and their Sins. The former after their departure out of this life are bleſſed, who are gone to Chriſt, and there are nearer to him, not by Faith, but face to face. And Homily the fourth on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46440:28"/>Tell me what mean thoſe bright Lamps in Funerals? Is it not that we bring forth the dead like victorious Combatants?

Theſe expreſſions agree with Purgatory like Water with Fire. How are they bleſſed with Chriſt, victorious, crowned, free from all ſorrows, at reſt and peace, who being of the number of the faithful, no groſs ſinners, but in a ſtate of Grace, are yet tormented in the fiery flames of Purgatory. The ſame Father in another place hath theſe words,

               <note place="margin">Ann. 1438.</note> in his Cenſure of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Confeſſion, and <hi>Cyril</hi> Patriarch of that Church in his Confeſſion of Faith, ſent by him to <hi>Cornelius Hage</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour for the States of <hi>Holland</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> An. 1630. deny any purgation of ſins after death by fire in Purgatory, which, ſay the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their Apology, was condemn'd by the fifth General Council, altho it is not now to be found in the late Editions of the Councils.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid I hope it is evident, Firſt, That there neither is nor ever was any Catholick or univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Chriſtian Churches as to this new <hi>Roman</hi> Article of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Purgatory. Secondly, That <hi>Bellarmin</hi> the

               <hi>Jeſuit</hi> doth but abuſe the World in quoting the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers as owning it. For, is it probable that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould underſtand their meaning in their Writings better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
            <p>It's true, ſome of them, as <hi>Origen, Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> &amp;c. mention Purgation of Souls from ſin by Fire, but it makes nothing for the Popiſh doctrine of Purgatory. For Firſt, <hi>Origen</hi>'s Purgatory is univerſal, which all, Prophets, Apoſtles,

Such Sentences of the Fathers will not at all be ſerviceable to our Adverſaries purpoſe. So much for the <hi>Greek;</hi> come we now to the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who in his <hi>Apologetick,</hi> Cap. 47. mentions onely two places to which Souls go, Hell and Paradiſe. In his Book <hi>De Teſtimon. Animae</hi> Cap. 4. He thus beſpeaketh the Soul: <hi>We affirm thee to remain after death, and to expect the day of judgment;
<note place="margin">Expectare diem Judicii proque meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aut cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatui deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, aut refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerio utroque ſempiterno.</note> and according to your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be deſtinated to torment or comfort;</hi> and both <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> As for temporary torments in the fire of Purgatory before the day of Judgment, <hi>Tertullian</hi> takes no notice of them. In his fifth Book againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> Cap. 6. comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that famous place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. he rightly underſtandeth the Gold, Silver, Hay, Stubble, not of ſins venial or mortal, but Doctrines worthy or unworthy of the foundation, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt or Chriſtian Religion,
<note place="margin">Strom 5. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> with whom agrees <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alex.</hi> in his fourth Book Cap. 34. againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> as alſo <hi>De Anima</hi> Cap. 35.55. he ſaith, The Souls <hi>of all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are in</hi> Abraham <hi>'s boſom,</hi> in refrigerio, <hi>a place of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until the Reſurrection</hi> (as many of the ancient Fathers
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46440:29"/>thought) <hi>when they ſhall receive</hi> plenitudinem mercedis, <hi>the fulneſs of their reward;</hi> Not, as Papiſts now teach, any of them in Purgatorian torments. It is farther obſervable, that he there diſtinguiſheth that place from Hell or any part of it, as Purgatory is ſuppoſed to be. And diſcourſing on thoſe words apply'd by <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to Purgatory, <hi>Thou ſhalt not come out thence till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing;</hi> He affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that all Souls abide <hi>apud inferos,</hi> till the Reſurrection. Which utterly overthrows the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine of Purgatory and renders all their Maſſes, Indulgences, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> vain and unprofitable.</p>
            <p>From the Maſter let us paſs to his Scholar Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who in his Epiſtle to <hi>Demetrian,</hi> ſaith, that at the ending of this temporal life we are ſevered into the receptacles either of <hi>eternal death</hi> or <hi>immortality.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ad aeternae mortis vel immortalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis hoſpitia dividamur,</hi> p. 166.</note> And in his Book <hi>De bono mortalitatis,</hi> he comforts the Chriſtians generally in a time of raging Peſtilence with theſe conſiderations: That the ſervants of Chriſt when they die, depart, as <hi>Simeon</hi> deſired, <hi>in peace. Enter into Paradiſe, go to Chriſt, begin to reign with Chriſt, that when they are taken out of the ſtorms of this World they gain the haven of Reſt and eternal ſecurity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Securitatis aeternae por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum petimus.</note> Laſtly, <hi>That after death the righteous are call'd</hi> ad refrigerium <hi>to refreſhment;</hi> (not torment in Purgatory fire whither ſome are ſent by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>) and the <hi>unrighteous to puniſhment.</hi> All which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are utterly inconſiſtent with this new Article of Faith; as every man not blinded with prejudice may eaſily diſcern. To the ſame purpoſe in his Epiſtle to <hi>Antonium;</hi> he adviſeth, in contradiction to the bitter doctrine of <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that pardon and peace ſhould be granted to Penitents <hi>in extremis,</hi> at or a little before their death; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>apud inferos exomologeſis fieri non poſſet, in Hell or the ſtate of death, or in the grave (as the word</hi> Inferi <hi>is ſometimes taken) there can be no ſatisfaction made by ſuffering penance or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin.</hi> It's true, in the latter end of the ſame Epiſtle, he ſaith, It's one thing to be preſently admitted to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Faith or heavenly Glory, and another to be purged from ſins by being long tormented in fire. But this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is no good proof of the <hi>Roman</hi> Purgatory, in regard he there ſpeaketh expreſly <hi>De die judicii,</hi> of the day of Judgement after the Reſurrection; whereas our Adverſaries
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46440:29"/>confeſs, that their Purgatory Fire is of no uſe after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and eternal Judgment. The like ſaying he hath in his Epiſtle to <hi>Demetrian.</hi> After we have gone out of this life, <hi>nullus remanet ſatisfactionis locus; There is no place for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying for our ſins. Here life is got or loſt for ever.</hi> Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſay, after we are gone out of this World we may by ſuffering in Purgatory fully ſatisfie God for our ſins, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat our <hi>Exomologeſis</hi> or Penance, obtaining thereby at laſt life eternal. Surely Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> was of another opinion.</p>
            <p>Come we to <hi>Lactantius. The Heathens,</hi> ſaith he,

               <hi>ſpeak of a</hi> Bivium <hi>two ways,</hi> apud inferos, <hi>relating to the dead; which more truly ſay, that theſe two ways are Heaven and Hell, for to the righteous immortality, to the wicked eternal death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.</hi> Here <hi>Lactantius</hi> mentions two, not three ways, men go after death.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Latin</hi> Father is Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi> who in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on <hi>Matth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. 27.</note> overthroweth the main ground on which Purgatory is built; for he ſaith, expounding the Parable of the Virgins, <hi>Alienis meritis ac operibus neminem adjuvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that no man after this life can be helped or deliver'd by the good works or merits of others, becauſe every man muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily provide Oil for his own Lamp.</hi> The wiſe Virgins in Saint <hi>Hilary</hi>'s judgment are they, who embracing the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity or ſeaſon of this life, the time of repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, prepare themſelves for Chriſt's coming. The fooliſh are they who would be borrowing Oil of their Neighbours, provide not in time for themſelves, but depend on the courteſie of others, their Works, Prayers, Merits, which will ſtand them in no ſtead, when being out of their bodies they have neglected and loſt the time of repentance. If <hi>Hilary</hi> was in the right, redemption of Souls out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory by other mens Prayers, Merits, Faſtings, by Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Maſſes, Pardons, Scapularies, and ſuch fooliſh inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are all vain and inſignificant, which will ſtand men in no ſtead, yield them no help or relief. The ſame Father elſewhere maketh only two ſorts of men <hi>Fideles &amp; Impii,
<note place="margin">In Pſal. p. 120.</note> faithful and impious; The former,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>going out of the body are placed in</hi> Abraham's <hi>boſom, where they are kept free from evil,</hi> viz. of puniſhment, <hi>till after the reſurrection</hi> (ſo he thought) <hi>they be admitted into Heaven; the other are hindred like</hi> Dives
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46440:30"/>
               <hi>by the interpoſing Gulf from going thither.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe he diſcourſeth in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>I paſs to Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who in his Book <hi>De Bono Mortis,</hi> ſaith thus:
<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> 
               <hi>He that receiveth not here remiſſion of ſins ſhall not be there,</hi> i. e. in Heaven. He ſpeaketh indefinitely of all ſins whether mortal or venial. And again, Cap. 12. <hi>When that day,</hi> viz. of death, <hi>cometh, they go to their Redeemer, to the very boſom of</hi> Abraham, <hi>a place</hi> of reſt, not torment, ſpeaking of good Chriſtians. Certainly, it is harſh to affirm that juſtify'd perſons reconcil'd to God by Chriſt's bloud, (for as <hi>Hilary</hi> even now taught us, this muſt be done here in this life or no where) and conſequently in a ſtate of Grace and favour with him, ſhould in regard of ſome ſmall venial ſins or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as they are called, not fully ſatisfy'd for in this life by Penance, Faſting, Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be caſt into fiery torments, and to lie there many years, none know how long, unleſs helped out by the uncertain Prayers, Merits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of others; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly unleſs the alſufficient and abundantly ſatisfactory Merits of Chriſt be applyed to them by the Popes Indulgences.</p>
            <p>I add next Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Amos cap. 9.</note> who ſaith, When the Soul freed from the bands of the body ſhall have liberty to fly whither it will, or whither it is compell'd to go, <hi>It ſhall either be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Hell, of which it is written,</hi> In Hell who will confeſs to thee? <hi>or it ſhall be lifted up to Heaven.</hi> It ſeemeth a third place, <hi>viz.</hi> Purgatory, <hi>Hierom</hi> knew not.</p>
            <p>I will end with Saint <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who having mention'd Heaven and Hell,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hypognoſt.</hi> lib. 5. <hi>De Pecc. mer. &amp; remiſſ.</hi> c. 28. Epiſt. 80.</note> adds, <hi>A third place we are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, neither do we find it in holy Scripture.</hi> Elſewhere he ſaith, <hi>There is no middle place to any, that he ſhould not be with the Devil, who is not with Chriſt.</hi> In his Epiſtle to <hi>Heſychius,</hi> he writeth thus: <hi>In what ſtate the day of death findeth any one, accordingly ſhall he be judged at the laſt day.</hi> The like Sentence almoſt word for word we find in <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Dial. <hi>p.</hi> 107.</note> who quoteth it as a ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>In what things I find you, ſo will I judge you.</hi> In his Epiſtle to <hi>Macedonius,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>After this life there is no place to correct our manners or what hath been amiſs.</hi> How then can Repentance or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſatisfaction for ſins be perfected or ſupply'd after death? I will add his words upon the 31. <hi>Pſalm, If God pardon ſins he will cover them; if he cover them, he will not take notice
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46440:30"/>of them, if he will not take notice of them, he will not puniſh them.</hi> How is this reconcileable with Gods puniſhing the ſins that he hath pardon'd, in Purgatory? It's true, We know God puniſheth ſometimes in this life ſuch as he pardons, for their future amendment and for example to others; but what is this to puniſhing men after this life, when there is no amendment poſſible, as our Adverſaries grant, nor others to be thereby warned?</p>
            <p>I acknowledge there are ſome places quoted by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others, wherein St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſeemeth to own Purgation of the Souls of ſome men from ſin after this life, as <hi>De Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſi lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contr. Manich.</hi> Cap. 10. <hi>de Civit. Dei, lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. Altho <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Comment. <hi>in locum.</hi>
               </note> the place is not to be found in the antient Manuſcripts, nor in that printed at <hi>Friburge, Hom.</hi> 16. <hi>inter</hi> 50. <hi>in Pſalm</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>But in his <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> his Book <hi>De fide &amp; operibus,</hi> and <hi>Ad Dulcitium,</hi> where he profeſſedly handles this Point, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the principal place of Scripture now urged by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> for their Doctrine of Purgatory; he ſpeaketh very doubtfully and uncertainly. Firſt, He acknowledgeth that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. is difficult and obſcure, one of thoſe intimated by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt. Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. of the true meaning of which he was not certain. But ſuch an obſcure place is, as all will grant, a very unfit ground to build an Article of Faith upon, which to deny ſhall be Hereſie and deſtructive of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Secondly, To <hi>Dulcitius,</hi> quoting his own Books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd, he interprets it expreſly <hi>De igne doloris,</hi> of the figurative and metaphorical Fire of grief, (according to <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39. <hi>My heart was hot within me, at laſt the fire kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> &amp;c.) ariſing from the loſs of temporal enjoyments, as Eſtate, Wealth, &amp;c. too earneſtly loved, yet renounced, and with ſome reluctancy forſaken for Chriſt's ſake and the Goſpels. Such a man, ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is <hi>ſaved, yet as it were by fire,</hi> urit enim eum dolor, <hi>for grief burneth him,</hi> as <hi>Latin</hi> Authors ſpeak. So that by <hi>Fire</hi> in that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. This learned Father did not, ſo far as I can perceive, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any proper and material fire but Metaphorical onely. Then he immediately adds, Whether therefore in this life only men ſuffer theſe things, <hi>i. e</hi> as I ſaid before, this figurative fire of grief, or alſo after this life ſome ſuch <hi>judicia,</hi> judgments
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46440:31"/>or puniſhments follow the ſenſe of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum arbitror,</hi> as I think abhors not from truth. So that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth not peremptorily aſſert it as a point of Catholick Faith to be believed neceſſarily to Salvation, that there is any ſuch, to wit, grief after this life, but leaveth it uncertain, and delivereth it as his opinion onely. Thirdly, It is worthy of our obſervation, that they who held (amongſt whom Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> was one) that all Chriſtians,

            <p>From all that hath been ſaid I infer, Firſt, That the Fire mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. is not the Popiſh Purgatory fire, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo underſtand it. Secondly, That the true ſenſe of that place is, as he confeſſeth, very difficult, dark and obſcure. Thirdly, That whatſoever Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> inferr'd from it, Whether that there is after this life a proper, or only a figurative fire of Grief, it is no part of the Antient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46440:32"/>Faith, but a truth, if <hi>a truth,</hi> which a true Chriſtian may be ignorant of without peril of damnation. <hi>Quaripoteſt, It may be queſtioned or ſought after, and poſſibly never be found out, but lie hid.</hi> Fourthly, That therefore Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> was no <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick,
<note place="margin">Lib. quarto Dialog. cap.</note> or of Pope <hi>Pius</hi>'s faith. I might add, that even Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great confeſſeth that the Fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. may be underſtood of temporal affliction: but I ſhall not deſcend ſo low at this time.</p>
            <p>To theſe expreſs places quoted out of Saint <hi>Auſtin, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> replies,
<note place="margin">39. <hi>Apud Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm.</hi> lib. 10. c. 5. <hi>de Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorio.</hi>
               </note> that he doubted not of Purgatory, but of the quality of the puniſhment and ſins there to be purged.</p>
            <p>But it's evident from his own words above recited: Firſt, That he underſtood not the Fire mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. (the principal place alledged by our Adverſaries) in a proper and natural ſenſe as they do, but moral and Metaphorical, not of material but figurative Fire, the fire of Grief. The <hi>Greeks</hi> in their Apology deny not Pardon or purgation of ſome ſins after death, tho not by material fire, for which nevertheleſs the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church condemns them as Hereticks and rejecters of Purgatory. Secondly, It's undeniable that he did not hold the Purgation of ſins after death, no not by the fire of Grief, much leſs material fire, to be an undoubted truth or Article of Chriſtian Faith,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Purgat.</hi> lib. 10. cap. ult.</note> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in that place affirmeth it to be.</p>
            <p>But in regard the words of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Antonian</hi> are much urged by ſome as clearly confirming the Romiſh Doctrine of Purgatory, where he writeth, <hi>Aliud eſt ſtatim fidei &amp; virtutis mercedem accipere, aliud pro peccatis longo dolore cruciatum emendari &amp; purgari diu igne: It's one thing preſently to receive the reward of Faith and Vertue; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for one being long tormented with grief for his ſins to be cleanſed and purged a great while in fire.</hi> To anſwer this place, we are firſt of all to obſerve the occaſion of theſe words: Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> a little before takes notice of an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Hereticks againſt the receiving the <hi>Lapſi,</hi> ſuch as for fear in time of Perſecution, like <hi>Peter,</hi> denied Chriſt. They alledged, that if ſuch might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Abſolution and the Communion of the Church, none would be Martyrs, or lay down their lives for the faith of Chriſt. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> anſwers, not ſo; for altho a time of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46440:32"/>Penance and then Peace, is granted to Adulterers, yet Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity and Continency did not languiſh or decay in the Church. Then follow the words above mentioned, <hi>Aliud eſt,</hi> &amp;c. It's evident enough then that the Fire here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is not to be underſtood of any proper and material Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorian fire, which Papiſts plead for, but Metaphorical, or of the fire of Grief, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> expounds the Fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. which place moſt probably Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> here alludes unto; in regard ſuch as fell away in time of Perſecution were not to be admitted to the peace of the Church until they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the grief and ſhame of a publick,
<note place="margin">As <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> grants, <hi>de Purgat.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 5.</note> long and ſevere Penance, termed <hi>Exomologeſis.</hi> So much Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s own words intimate: It's one thing preſently to receive, as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs did, the reward of their Faith and Vertue (a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Martyrdom) another to be cleanſed <hi>longo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore</hi> with long grief, and (which are Paraphraſtical of his former words) to be long purged with fire. To this I ſhall add, that it was the Opinion of many of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Irenaeus, Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Lactantius,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Biblioth.</hi> l. 6. annotat. 345.</note> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> with others quoted by <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> that none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Martyrs were immediately upon their death admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted admitted to the preſence of God, <hi>ad oſcula Domini,</hi> to receive the Crown of Eternal Glory, but were kept <hi>in loco inviſibili,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> or <hi>in abditis receptaculis,</hi> in ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inviſible places until the day of Judgment, ſollicitouſly expecting then to receive their final Sentence; this is <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere in die judicii ad ſententiam Domini,</hi> as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> there phraſeth it.</p>
            <p>Thus I hope I have given (let the <hi>Learned</hi> Reader judge) a true and fair interpretation of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words, which do not import any proper fire to purifie Souls before the day of Judgment; ſo that upon the view of what is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, we may conclude that the Romiſh Doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory is no part of the Antient, Primitive and Apoſtolick Faith, but in the Fifth Century in Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s days began to be a doubtful and uncertain Opinion only. So much at preſent for Purgatory.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:46440:33"/>
            <p>I ſhould now make ſome enquiry in the Writings of the Antient Fathers after Indulgences, the fuel that feeds this Purgatorian Fire.
<note place="margin">Lib. 80. <hi>Tit. Indulgentiae.

The Popes Martyr <hi>Roffenſis</hi> confeſſeth the uſe of them was <hi>ſero re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus in Eccleſia,</hi> of late received by the Church. Of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, he ſaith, there is eſpecially amongſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers, <hi>ferè nulla mentio,</hi> almoſt no mention of it. Now Indulgences, as is granted, are grounded on Purgatory; they muſt ſtand and fall together. So long, ſaith he, as there was no care or fear of Purgatory no Man ſought for Pardons; for on it depends all the credit of Pardons: Take away Purgatory, and what uſe of Pardons? When therefore Purgatory was ſo lately known and received in the Church, who now can marvel at Pardons, that in the beginning of the Church there was no uſe of them. Pardons therefore began after that they had trembled a while at the pains of Purgatory. Thus he. <hi>Antoninus, Sylveſter, Pierius, Oſtienſis,</hi> the <hi>Lovain Divines, Polydore Virgil, Cajetan,</hi> and others, of whom more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſay as much: ſo that it will be labour in vain to ſearch for them in the Writings of the antient Authors. Here I cannot but wonder our Adverſaries do not bluſh to boaſt of their preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Faith and Church, as if they were the ſame, only the ſame, with the antient Primitive and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick one, and to accuſe us Proteſtants of Novelty, Hereſie, and ſetting up a new Faith and Church under the Banner of <hi>M.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46440:35"/>hereby a Papiſt is not) would pray to receive any thing of God and Angels or any Creature.

               </gap> It is evident the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> joined none in his prayer to God but the Word, whom he therefore calleth <hi>the Angel,</hi> becauſe he alone revealeth the Father.

            <p>I will add his Contemporary Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi> who altho he granteth (which Proteſtants deny not) that the Angels pray for the Church Militant here on Earth, yet he no where alloweth Invocation of them, but on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 29, and 124. he adviſeth all Chriſtians to pray to God, in regard he is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent in all places, ready to help, which is not true of Saints or Angels. In like manner on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 140. he ſaith,

            <p>Hitherto the Coaſt is clear, and we have the unanimous conſent of the Fathers for about 340 years after Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Invocation of Saints, Angels or any Creature. Whence we undoubtedly conclude that it is, tho a part of the preſent <hi>Roman,</hi> yet not of the true antient and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith believed <hi>ſemper, ubique, &amp; apud omnes,</hi> always, in all places, by all ſound Chriſtians, for ſuch Doctrines, as <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> rightly notes, are onely truly Catholick, that is, Univerſal, as the name it ſelf <hi>Catholick</hi> ſignifies.</p>

In his Funeral Oration on <hi>Gordius,</hi> he acquainteth us with the true ends of thoſe commendatory or commemoratory Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties obſerved on the <hi>Natalitia</hi> or Feſtivals of the Martyrs, to wit, to glorifie God, and to ſtir up the people to imitation of their Virtues, but no mention find we there of praying to them.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that out of <hi>Baſil, Nazianzen, Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> &amp;c. their Funeral Orations, ſome Rhetorical Apoſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes to and Compellations of the Saints deceaſed are urged for Invocation of Saints by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, That in the moſt Primitive and antient Fathers, we as we have ſeen, find them not; from the beginning it was not ſo. Secondly, That Rhetorical flouriſhes of Eloquence are no ſafe and ſure grounds to build an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith upon, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> grants, <hi>Non ego dogmatum regulam ea duco,

               </gap> he offereth up Sacrifices for us. Yet no Papiſt will ſay that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46440:36"/>he celebrated Maſs, or as we ſpeak, the Holy Enchariſt, or conſecrated it in Heaven, as that phraſe of Offering Sacrifice is ſometimes uſed by the Fathers. In like manner he ſaith of his Father,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Mountague</hi> of Invocation of the Saints,</note> O ſacred and divine Head, <hi>reſpice nos quaeſo de caelo,</hi> look on us from Heaven; So <hi>Billius</hi> a Papiſt, falſly tranſlates it. In the <hi>Greek</hi> the word is, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>O ſi,</hi> or <hi>utinam nos de caelo reſpiceres;</hi> O that, or I wiſh, thou mighteſt look down from Heaven on us. So that it is rather a Wiſh than a true Prayer.

            </p>

But who can imagine or believe that <hi>Nazianzen, Baſil</hi> and other of the antient Fathers would have ſpoken concerning the Saints departed, their knowledge of humane affairs, ſo doubtfully and uncertainly, if they had in the leaſt believed that Invocation of Saints in Heaven was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Catholick Faith neceſſary to be believed under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of Hereſie and Damnation. <hi>Credat Judaeus Apella, non ego.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I go on, I will take particular notice of a place quoted by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> out of Saint <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Oration on the 40 Martyrs in theſe words: <hi>Qui aliquâ premitur anguſtiâ ad hos confugiat,</hi> &amp;c. He that is in any affliction or ſtrait, let him fly to theſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> theſe Martyrs. To this I anſwer, Firſt, That <hi>Bellarmine</hi> abuſeth his Reader with a falſe <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which is not unuſual with him. In the <hi>Greek</hi> it is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46440:37"/>onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not let him, but he doth fly to them. Here is matter of fact or practice; they did ſo: But here is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, advice or counſel of Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> that they ſhould do ſo. Secondly, He exhorts them to join their Prayers unto, and with the ſupplications of the Martyrs. Here then we find Interceſſion by them, not Prayer to them. Thirdly, It is to be conſidered that theſe 40 Martyrs were all <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> of that Country,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Montague</hi> of Invocation of Saints.</note> and ſo being, as I ſuppoſe, not long ſince deceaſed, might retain ſome particular remembrance of the place of their Nativity, and near Relations. There is not the ſame reaſon of praying to Saints, who never knew us nor we them. Fourthly, In that very place Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that theſe 40 Martyrs, not ſeverally, but all together were at the ſame time with divers perſons in diſtant places, which whether it be a truth or no, I appeal to the judgment of any learned Papiſt. They in ſome things reject the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Fathers, as well as we. Laſtly, He ſpeaketh only of the place and time of their annual Feſtivity, which will not amount to a ſufficient ground of Invocation in any place, and at any time of need of any Saint.</p>
            <p>I now paſs on to St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who <hi>Hom.</hi> 44. in <hi>Gen. Hom.</hi> 5. in <hi>Matth. Hom. de Profectu Evang.</hi> and elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth his Hearers not to rely on the Interceſſion of others, but to go immediately to God themſelves, propounding to them the Example of the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hom. 12. in Matth.</note> who was never the better for the Apoſtles Interceſſion, who intreated not <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>James</hi> to beg for her, but went directly to Chriſt herſelf, and received a better anſwer from him. Then he addeth,
<note place="margin">V. Ambroſe infra.</note> There is no need of Interceſſors with God.</p>
            <p>I come to <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who in his Comment <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. hath theſe words, which give a deadly blow to this new point of Faith, to wit, worſhipping Angels mentioned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 18. They, ſaith he, who defended the Law perſuaded the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to worſhip An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſaying, that the Law was given by them. Obſerve, their reaſon is not becauſe they were Gods or Creators of the World, but deliverers of the Law, as Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> noteth, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. This Errour, ſaith he, remained a long time in <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Piſidia;</hi> wherefore the Synod of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> not far diſtant from <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> forbid by a Law or Canon <hi>praying</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:46440:37"/>to <hi>Angels,</hi> and to this day (adds he) are to be ſeen the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories (not of any Heatheniſh Idol) but of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel. This they adviſed, pretending or under a ſhew of voluntary humility; for they ſaid, God himſelf could not be ſeen or comprehended, neither could be approached unto, and we muſt gain his favour through the Angels. Thus <hi>Theodoret.</hi> Here we have the Original of the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Angels, to wit, certain Hereticks condemn'd by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> by the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> and <hi>Theodoret.</hi> We may note alſo, that the Argument uſed by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to eſtabliſh this pretended Article of Faith is borrowed from Hereticks, to wit, that God being infinite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, it becometh not the humility of ſinful Creatures to make immediate addreſſes to him, but to uſe the Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Angels the favourites of God. Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> is ſo netled with this teſtimony of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his pretended reverence of the Fathers, he ſaith plainly, <hi>Theodoreti pace dictum ſit, non aſſequitur mentem Pauli,

            <p>I had almoſt forgot the good old Father <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in all whoſe Writings <hi>Bellarmine</hi> it ſeemeth could find nothing for Invocation of Saints; but we can produce what is directly againſt it. <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 74. <hi>contra Collyrid.</hi> he condemneth certain fond Women of more zeal than knowledge, who like thoſe in <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 7.18.</note> offer'd up Cakes to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> as the Queen of Heaven (a Title the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks have, little to

If God will not have Angels worſhipped, how much leſs the Daughter of <hi>Ann,</hi> born as other Women (<hi>ergo</hi> in Original Sin.) What then do we, as <hi>Romaniſts</hi> calumniate us, or <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> deny <hi>Mary</hi> her due honour? No. We ſay with <hi>Epiphanius, Let her be in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but let God alone be adored;</hi> Let none worſhip <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe is to be honoured, (as we really grant) but ſhe is not given us <gap reason="foreign">

Certainly theſe fooliſh Women were not ſo filly as to take the Holy Virgin for a Goddeſs or Deity, (but adored her as the Mother of Chriſt) for then they had been plain Heathens rather than, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> eſteemed them, Hereticks. Surely, if offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> a few Cakes was heretical and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, is it not much worſe to offer up to her the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Sacrifices of (to ſay nothing now of their Maſſes in honour of her) Prayers, Vows and Thankſgivings, which themſelves acknowledge to be acts of <hi>Latria</hi> or <hi>Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>

            <p>I go on to Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> who in his Epitaph on <hi>Nepotian</hi> acknowledgeth, that although the Saints departed poſſibly pray for us, yet do not hear our prayers or Apoſtrophes to them:

Is any religious Worſhip properly ſo called, to be given to Saints or religious Perſons by us in this life? Let our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries conſider this. Laſtly, in his Book <hi>De Cura pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis,</hi> cap. 10.11, 12. He overthroweth the principal grounds and reaſons on which Invocation of Saints is built. For
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46440:39"/>firſt, He judgeth it very probable at leaſt, that the Saints or Martyrs did not really and perſonally appear to their Friends, although it was believed by many,
<note place="margin">Compare <hi>Baſil. M. in Mamantem.</hi>
               </note> but in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or appearance onely. Secondly, He proveth (which he ſaith he knew would be ill taken by ſome) that the ſouls of the departed Saints are in a place where they ſee or know not what is done by or happens to their neareſt Relations, from Gods Promiſe to <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.18. That he ſhould not ſee all the Evil he would bring on his People; as alſo from thoſe words of <hi>Eſaiah,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 63.16.</note> Abraham is ignorant of us and Iſrael knows us not.</hi> Whence he infers, <hi>ſi tanti Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchae,</hi> &amp;c. If ſuch great Patriarchs were ignorant of what happened to the People who ſprang from them, how are the dead intereſſed or concerned in knowing and helping their Friends? He confirmeth his concluſion thus: If the dead were intereſted in the affairs of the living, or ſpake to us in Dreams, my dear Mother would no night he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from me. But it's true, as in the <hi>Pſalm, My Father and my Mother have forſaken me,</hi> &amp;c. If our Parents have forſaken us, who elſe among the dead know what we do or ſuffer? Now our Adverſaries grant, that unleſs the Saints departed know our particular ſtate and wants, it is vain and to no purpoſe to pray unto them. Thirdly, He anſwers an Objection drawn from <hi>Dives</hi> his deſiring <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſend to his Brethren on Earth, wherefore he knew what they did. To this he replieth, <hi>Dives</hi> had ſuch or ſo great a care of the living, although he knew not what they did, as we have of the dead, although what they do we know not in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. It was onely a general care or well wiſhing: But, <hi>Abraham</hi> knew they had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. To this he anſwereth, that he might know it by the information of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Fourthly, He enquireth how the Saints come <hi>poſtea</hi> afterwards (ſo that this knowledge cometh too late to ground Prayer to Saints in preſent extremities and ſudden dangers.) He anſwereth, <hi>Poſſunt ab Angelis, poſſunt Deo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velante cognoſcere,</hi> they may know it by Angels who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with us, or by Revelation from God; they may, he ſaith not poſitively that they do. Fifthly, He maketh a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (which <hi>Romaniſts</hi> take little notice of) between Martyrs and other Saints, and denies that becauſe Martyrs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46440:40"/>
               <hi>per Divinam potentiam</hi> miraculouſly, or by ſpecial diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſometimes here on Earth in their Temples, therefore we are to think the ſame of all dead Saints generally, or that they can come to us <hi>quando volunt,</hi> when they will, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> determines.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>D. Sanct. Beatit.</hi> lib. 1. c. 20.</note> But miraculous Diſpenſations are no ſafe Rule for ordinary ſupplications to all Saints promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly. Laſtly, ſuppoſing it true that the living are helped ſome way or other by Martyrs prayed unto; he ſaith, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by their being preſent in ſo many diſtant places at the ſame time where their memories (<hi>i. e.</hi> Monuments or Churches) are, or (which no doubt he could not but think more probable) whether they being in ſome place remote from humane converſe are yet generally praying for ſuch as pray (not to them, but God who might employ Angels in anſwering their requeſts) as we pray in the general for the dead, although we know not where they are, or what they do, <hi>definire non audeo,</hi> I dare not reſolve. From all which we may eaſily diſcern how uncertain Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> was concerning the preſence, knowledge and aſſiſtance of Saints departed, afforded to ſome, not who pray to them but to God; from whence we may certainly conclude, that Invocation of dead Saints was no part of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Creed, but at utmoſt a probable and doubtful Opinion onely, as we have ſeen before from the writings of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, <hi>Nazianzen, Baſil</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>I know well, our Adverſaries urge much <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and how a Virgin aſſaulted by the Devil, prayed to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to help her.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Gelaſius</hi> with the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns that Book of the Converſion of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſuppoſed to be genuine, as falſe and ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; neither is it at all probable that Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> was ever a Magician, of which neither himſelf in the relation of his converſion,

<note place="margin">Lib. 4. <hi>Cont. Celſian.</hi> Pag. 284.</note> Our New Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks ſay, they turn the mind to God. In his ſixth Book he writeth thus: We count them rude and ignorant who are not aſhamed to ſpeak to ſenſleſs things,

For this the outward figure of members extort from us, that the mind living in the body, thinketh the more that the body ſo like its own body hath ſenſe alſo.

            <p>To all this it will I ſuppoſe be anſwered: Firſt, That the Fathers inveigh againſt making Images of God, or falſe Gods, not Saints.</p>
            <p>I reply: 1. Some of them expreſly condemn all Images. 2. Do not <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks (though ſome of their own Writers condemn it) make Images or Pictures of God the Father in the likeneſs of an old Man, and of the Holy Ghoſt of a Dove? True, ſay they, but we do it not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the nature of God, but certain properties and actions appertaining to God: I do not wonder, they ſay they do not what cannot be done, to wit, to repreſent by an Image the infinite, inviſible and incomprehenſible nature of God; But herein they ſay what even the Heathens ſaid of their Idols. For <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus</hi> quoted by <hi>Cyril, Xenophon</hi> by <hi>Minutius Foelix, Olympius</hi> by <hi>Sozomen</hi> confeſſed,
<note place="margin">Hiſt. Lib. 7. c. 15.</note> that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſignifie the incorporeal God by a Body, and that the form of God cannot be ſeen, that inviſible Spirits or heavenly Powers dwelt in thoſe corporeal Images, but they were not the Powers themſelves.</p>
            <p>It's granted,

                  <hi>Ne facias niſi &amp; tibi Deus juſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Tertul. de Idololat.</hi> c.</note> God and the Holy Ghoſt did appear in ſuch likeneſſes, what's that to us?

               </note> that they give religious worſhip to Images not for themſelves, <hi>propter ſe,</hi> but for the ſake of the Perſons they repreſent.</p>
            <p>The Heathens, as we have ſeen above, ſaid the very ſame. If <hi>Romiſh</hi> worſhip of Images be lawful, it will be difficult to condemn or convince the Heathens of Idolatry. The <hi>Jews</hi> did not worſhip the Calf for it ſelf, but as a Repreſentative of God.</p>

            <p>I anſwer that, as we have ſhewn above, they give to the Images of God and Crucifixes the ſame Divine worſhip they yield unto God and Chriſt themſelves.

Concerning the Fathers before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, called above 300 years after Chriſt, we need not make any ſtrict enquiry, ſeeing <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> (who was Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf afterwards) confeſſeth,

               </note> then the <hi>Roman.</hi> How can ſhe then be <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; Magiſtra,</hi> the <hi>Mother and Miſtris of all Churches,</hi> as is now pretended by our <hi>Romaniſts?</hi> This was that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who ſharply reproved <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for threatning or attempting at leaſt to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Biſhops and Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 5. Hiſt. Eccl. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note> for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the ſame day he did, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time lived <hi>Polyerates</hi> the renowned Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> (with whom many Catholick Biſhops meeting in ſeveral Councils concurred,) who oppoſed Pope <hi>Victor</hi>'s Sentence, and profeſſed he was not at all terrified with his threatned Excommunication, but reſolutely perſiſted in the Tradition and Cuſtom received from his Predeceſſors, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, as we find in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> lib. 5. Hiſt. c. 23.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:46440:44"/>
            <p>Hence it is evident that <hi>Polycrates,</hi> as alſo <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> did not look upon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as Prince and Sovereign Head of the Church, or more infallible than any other Biſhop. It's true, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had a great reverence for the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and teſtifieth to her honour, that in his days the Apoſtolick Doctrine or Tradition remained pure and incorrupt, which he oppoſed to the Heretical Novelties of the <hi>Valentinians:</hi> But this no way proveth that ſhe had Supreme Juriſdiction over all Churches; But in regard it would be long, as he ſaith, to <hi>reckon up all Apoſtolical Churches, as of</hi> Corinth, Epheſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> (to whom he giveth the ſame teſtimony of purity of doctrine) he inſtances in <hi>Rome, propter potentiorem principalitatem, in regard of its more powerful principality,</hi> known to all. But theſe words plainly enough relate not to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church immediately as a Chriſtian Church, but to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which at that time was the Imperial City and Head of the World. Alas! What powerful Principality could the poor perſecuted Church of <hi>Rome</hi> enjoy then, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under Heathen Emperours? It is not therefore meant ſtrictly and properly of an Eccleſiaſtical, but Civil Power and Principality of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi>

               </note> in which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſojourned, as St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> writeth to them, whereby through concourſe of all Nations, it was rendred more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and honourable to the World. The words of <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> before mentioned confirm the ſame.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> I find nothing concerning this matter.</p>
            <p>I will go on to <hi>Tertullian: Run through,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Churches. If ye be near</hi> Achaia, <hi>ye have</hi> Corinth; <hi>if</hi> Macedonia, Philippi <hi>and</hi> Theſſalonica: <hi>ſi Italiae adjaces, habes Romam; If ye live near</hi> Italy, <hi>ye have</hi> Rome. Where firſt obſerve, that he with <hi>Irenaeus</hi> aſcribeth the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to <hi>Corinth, Philippi,</hi> &amp;c. which he doth to <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, He ſpeaketh not of Juriſdiction, but matter of Faith and Apoſtolick Doctrine. Thirdly, It's conditional, if you be near <hi>Italy,</hi> you have <hi>Rome. Tertullian</hi> never thought that all Chriſtian Churches were ſubject to <hi>Rome,</hi> either as to Doctrine or Government, or were bound to appeal and ſub mit unto her. Again, Chap. 20. The Apoſtles having firſt preached the Goſpel in <hi>Judea</hi> promulged the ſame doctrine
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46440:45"/>of Faith to the Nations. — In regard of this doctrine they are accounted Apoſtolical. — Wherefore ſo many and great Churches are that one <hi>firſt Church</hi> from the Apoſtles, of which all are. So all are firſt <hi>omnes primae,</hi> and all Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, whilſt all prove one Unity; Now if all are firſt, all Apoſtolical, how can the <hi>Roman</hi> Church claim any Primacy or Principality over all, even Apoſtolical Churches?</p>

What was ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> was ſpoken to all the Apoſtles and Chriſtians. All are <hi>Peter</hi> and the Rock.

<note place="margin">Epiſt. 45.47.49.</note> Let us hearken to Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who uſually wrote to Pope <hi>Cornelius</hi> as to his Brother, Colleague and Fellow-Biſhop, not as his Prince and Sovereign, or Univerſal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, eſpecially in his 72.

'In which matter we force no man, we give Law to no man, ſeeing every Biſhop hath the free liberty of his own will in the adminiſtration or Government of his Church, being to give account of his actions (not to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but) to God. In his Preface before the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> he hath theſe words: <hi>None of us maketh himſelf Biſhop of Biſhops</hi> (i. e. Supreme Univerſal Biſhop) <hi>or compelleth his Colleagues by tyrannical terrour to obedience,</hi> &amp;c. where he ſeemeth to reflect on Pope <hi>Stephen.</hi> Compare thoſe words of <hi>Tertullian de Pudicit.</hi> c. 10.

In his Epiſtle 74. he writeth againſt Pope <hi>Stephen,</hi> charging him with Errour, and pleading the cauſe of Hereticks againſt the Church of God.

               </note> that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church was guilty of violating the Antient Canons, and that Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> by Excommunicating ſo many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, Excommunicated himſelf. I will add that noted paſſage of St. <hi>Cyprian, Idem caeteri quod Petrus,</hi> &amp;c. The reſt of the Apoſtles were the ſame with <hi>Peter,</hi> endowed with an equal fellowſhip or copartnerſhip of Honour and Power. They are all Paſtors, but the Flock is but one, which is to be fed by all (not <hi>Peter</hi> onely or his Succeſſours by vertue of <hi>feed my ſheep</hi>) by <hi>unanimous conſent,</hi> not by depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by or ſubjection to <hi>Peter</hi> and ſuch as ſucceed him at <hi>Rome.</hi> A little before, he ſaith, Although Chriſt granted to all the Apoſtles after his Reſurrection <hi>parem poteſtatem, equal power,</hi> breathing on them the Holy Ghoſt, and ſaying, <hi>whoſe ſins ye remit,</hi> &amp;c. Yet to <hi>manifeſt Unity,</hi> he appointed one Chair; He ſpeaketh to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>to thee will I give,</hi> &amp;c. ſingularly; Why? not that <hi>Peter</hi> had a greater Power or Authority (which he expreſly denied before) than the reſt of the Apoſtles: but, ſaith Saint <hi>Cyprian, to commend to us Unity,</hi> that the Church ought to be one without Schiſm to the end of the World; which is the intent of all that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Now, if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had no Supremacy over all the Apoſtles and Churches, the Pope as deriving it from him can have juſt right to none. Let me add Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s 67. Epiſtle, where he adviſeth them what to do concerning the Heretical <hi>French</hi> Biſhop, whom he would not have the People to own, though he had ſurreptitiouſly obtained Pope <hi>Stephens</hi> confirmation.

Surely, if the Paſſion of Chriſt on the Croſs be the Sacrifice we offer to God, evident it is, that it can be offered only by way of commemoration or remembrance; for Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered but once on the Croſs, which was performed above 1600 years ago.

(The ſame do Proteſtants) otherwiſe by conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and devoting our ſelves to God, and dedicating Soul and Body to his High-Prieſt, the Word. Ye ſee here how many ſorts of Chriſtian Sacrifices <hi>Euſebius</hi> reckons up, Prayers, Praiſes, conſecrating our ſouls and bodies to God, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the memory of his Sacrifice on the Croſs; but concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrificing of Chriſt himſelf in and by the ſacramental Myſteries, we find nothing.

The truth is, the Maſs Prieſts, if Tranſubſtantiation be admitted, offer neither Bread nor Wine, which they tell us are changed into Chriſts Body and Bloud, which are corporal things.

Doth this imply, that the Bread and Wine are miraculouſly changed into the body and bloud of Chriſt? or that repreſenting Chriſts body and bloud in the Holy Sacrament rendreth them a Sacrifice, or implieth any offering them up as a propitiatory Victim for the ſins both of quick and dead? Certainly, did this ſacrificing Chriſt by or under Bread and Wine at all appertain to the Chriſtian Prieſthood, <hi>Euſebius</hi> no doubt would have (it being ſo eminent and wonderful an action) made at leaſt ſome little mention of it.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46440:61"/>Proteſtants, and Profeſſours of our Antient, not of their new-minted <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, made as to ſome parts of it, to wit, Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and framed in late Councils, near twelve hundred years after the deceaſe of the Apoſtles?</p>
            <p>To their uſual Queſtion then, Where was the Proteſtant Church or Religion before <hi>Luther?</hi> I Anſwer, Firſt, That it was there, where their whole Religion cannot, as they grant, be found; to wit, in the Holy Scriptures. Secondly, It was,

               </note> as Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> ſaith well, where their Church was, in the ſame place, though not in the ſame ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Reformation or Proteſtantiſm did not make a new Faith or Church, but reduced things to the Primitive purity; Plucked not up the good Seed, the Catholick Faith or true Worſhip, but the after-ſown Tares of Errour, as Image-worſhip, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were ready to choak it. Did the Reformation in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s or <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s days, ſet up a new Church or Religion different in eſſence from the old one?

            <p>Not to be too tedious: This Queſtion, Where was the Proteſtant Church in the Ages before <hi>Luther,</hi> ariſeth from ſeveral miſtakes: Firſt, From want of diſtinguiſhing betwixt a <hi>true</hi> viſible Church and a <hi>ſound</hi> one. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church from which <hi>Luther</hi> and others received their Baptiſm and Ordination, We grant to be a part or member of the Catholick Church, but it was unſound and ſubject to many Diſeaſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> corruptions in Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which like ill humours endangered its very life. The Reformation wherein <hi>Luther</hi> with many more were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, was not Poiſon to deſtroy its Vitals, but purgative Phyſick to remove its diſtempers, and to preſerve them. Secondly, It's a miſtake, that they will not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the avowed and univerſally owned Doctrines of a Church, and the Opinions or practices of ſome few or many in it. In the Churches of <hi>Pergamus</hi> or <hi>Thyatira</hi> there were ſome, and poſſibly not a few, who held the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and were ſeduced by that wicked <hi>Jezabel,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be a Propheteſs and infallible; yet theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines were not properly the Doctrines of thoſe Churches, but of a party in them. The like we ſay of the Errours in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were never univerſally owned and allowed, no not by many eminent Profeſſours and Writers of her own Communion, as we have made evident. Thirdly, It's a great miſtake when they demand that we ſhew the Proteſtant Religion and Church diſtinct and ſeparate from the Catholick in all Ages, when we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46440:62"/>and prove, that not onely in the Apoſtles days, but for near five hundred years after, the true Apoſtolick Faith was, at leaſt as to ſubſtance, kept pure and uncorrupt. Would they have us to ſhew Proteſtants proteſting againſt the antient and Primitive Faith? As for their New <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine</hi> Articles of Faith, they were to be ſure, not ſome of them then in being to be proteſted againſt. Fourthly, It's a groſs miſtake to think, that all who live in a true but corrupted Chriſtian Church, are either bound to approve of thoſe corruptions, or at all times neceſſary to ſeparate actually and perſonally from the Church for their ſake.
<note place="margin">See Bull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Can.</note> This Proteſtants condemn in <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Browniſts</hi> or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts. The Errors and corruptions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were a long time growing in or upon her. The Tares were not ſeen as ſoon as they were ſown, but after they were grown up. God forbid we ſhould condemn to Hell all our Forefathers, that lived and died in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. In the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>'s, <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s, <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s days the true Viſible Church of God was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, both Princes, Prieſts and People ſeverely reproved, yet the Prophets adviſed none to ſeparate therefore from the Temple and Worſhip of God, although no doubt their mind was that all, as far as was poſſible, ſhould keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free and undefiled from thoſe prevalent corruptions. Likewiſe, our Bleſſed Saviour forſook not the Temple; and although he warned them to <hi>take heed of the leaven,</hi> i. e. falſe Doctrines, of the Scribes and Phariſees, yet in regard they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Chair, he commands the people to do as they ſaid (<hi>i. e.</hi> according to the Law) and conſequently to go and hear what they ſaid. Much, very much, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> and other Fathers tell us, is to be born rather than to make a Schiſm in the Church of God. On this ground no doubt many of our Forefathers before the Reformation continued till death in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that ſo they might enjoy the benefit of the Word and Sacraments; although they mourned for and groaned under the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing predominancy of many Errors and ſuperſtitious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in their days, heartily deſiring, yea openly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a removal of them, but could not obtain it.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46440:63"/>So were the Catholicks under the Heathen and <hi>Arian</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Emperours. Certainly no prudent Chriſtian will take Proſperity, Victory, outward Pomp and Power to be certain notes or perpetual properties of the true Church and right Believers: nay Adverſity and perſecution rather, as our Saviour intimates, when he aſſures his Apoſtles, they ſhould be hated of all men for his Names ſake, and that the time would ſoon come, when whoſoever killed them ſhould think, (as the Cruſadoes and their Military Saint <hi>Dominic</hi> no doubt thought) they did God ſervice. It's ſufficient to our preſent purpoſe, that we ſhew ſome who held with us againſt the preſent Doctrine of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
            <p>But here I expect their uſual Objection: That many of the Writers and Perſons we alledg did not in all things agree with the Proteſtants, though in ſome particulars they conſented.</p>
            <p>True, no more did they in all things agree with the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church. If ſome who believed not the Popes Supremacy, the Sacrifice of Chriſt in the Maſs, Merits, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were yet Members as of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, ſo <hi>Roman</hi> Church and were ſaved (which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no Papiſt will deny:) Why are we Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd as Hereticks to Hell for believing as ſome of their Infallible Popes, and Canonized Saints have done? I challenge any Papiſt to ſhew me one National or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Church (I might go farther) in the whole World, that for at leaſt twelve hundred years after Chriſt, did in all points believe as the <hi>Trent</hi> Council have decreed; or profeſſed that Catholick Religion, which Pope <hi>Pius</hi> hath ſumm'd up in his Creed: We may ask them, Where was your <hi>Tridentine</hi> Faith and Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> Was Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Great for receiving the Communion in one kind? Was Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great for worſhipping of Images, or for that proud, profane, Antichriſtian and fooliſh name (as he calls it) of <hi>Univerſal Biſhop?</hi> Were <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Biſhops for Appeals to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all Churches to the Popes Univerſal juriſdiction?

Who hath ſo hard a forehead as to affirm it, or ſo ſoft a head as to believe it?</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely add, That it is no wonder, if many good Men and learned did not at once ſee and diſcover in an Age wherein Ignorance and Superſtition abounded, all theſe Errours, Abuſes, and corruptions which infected the Church of God, but did in ſome things, not altogether ſo groſs and palpably wicked as others, <hi>errare errorem ſeculi. follow the current of the times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To end, I hope Sir, by what hath been ſaid, you plainly perceive that thoſe Doctrines and Practices Proteſtants have rejected, were never any part of the true, Primitive and Catholick Faith contained in the Scriptures or the Writings of the Antient Fathers and Councils. Yea, that in the later, and as is confeſſed, worſt Ages of the Church, were never received and viſibly profeſſed by all true Catholicks, whether of the <hi>Grecian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Communion.
<note place="margin">See <hi>Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</note> The moſt and beſt that can be ſaid, is, that at firſt ſome of them were the private Sentiments, and doubtful Opinions of ſome Worthy Men; as Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the fourth or fifth Century: Which after many Ages by the Policy and Power of the Pope and his Party were obtruded by the Councils of <hi>Lateran, Conſtance, Florence, Trent,</hi> &amp;c. as Articles of Faith, on this <hi>Weſtern</hi> part of the World, but not without viſible oppoſition and open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. I have ſhewn how multitudes of learned and pious Men did complain of them, and write againſt them; and others, as the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> forced by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and perſecution ſeparated themſelves, (as the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Chriſtians did under the prevalence of the <hi>Arians</hi>) actually and perſonally from them, beſides others who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, yet for fear of perſecution more privately and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſome ſenſe or degree inviſibly renounced and deteſted them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here add, that indeed this is more than we are in reaſon bound to ſhew; for it was ſufficient to prove the perpetual exiſtence or viſibility of the Catholick Church,
